# Sea Level Rise Analysis

This project analyzes sea level data and visualizes trends using Python. It creates a scatter plot of sea levels over time and plots two lines of best fit to predict sea level rise by 2050. The visualization includes:

1. **Scatter Plot**: Shows the sea level data points over time.
2. **Line of Best Fit (1880-2050)**: Predicts sea level rise based on all available data.
3. **Line of Best Fit (2000-2050)**: Predicts sea level rise based on data from the year 2000 onwards.

The x-axis represents the year, and the y-axis represents the sea level in inches. The title of the plot is "Rise in Sea Level."
